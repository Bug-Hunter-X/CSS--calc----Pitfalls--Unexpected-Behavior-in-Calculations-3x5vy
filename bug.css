The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it doesn't work as expected if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 20);` will likely fail because `20` lacks units.  Another issue arises if you mix percentages and pixel values without being mindful of the calculation order.  Also, using `calc()` within nested calculations might lead to unexpected results.
